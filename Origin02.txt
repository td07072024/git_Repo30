The population of South Asia during the Mauryan period has been estimated to be between 15 and 30 million.[30] The empire's period of dominion was marked by exceptional creativity in art, architecture, inscriptions and produced texts,[3] but also by the consolidation of caste in the Gangetic plain, and the declining rights of women in the mainstream Indo-Aryan speaking regions of India.[31] Archaeologically, the period of Mauryan rule in South Asia falls into the era of Northern Black Polished Ware (NBPW). The Arthashastra[32] and the Edicts of Ashoka are the primary sources of written records of Mauryan times. The Lion Capital of Ashoka at Sarnath is the State Emblem of the Republic of India.
